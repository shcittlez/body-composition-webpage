# Body Composition Calculator
A responsive web application that calculates body composition metrics such as body fat percentage, lean body mass, and health ratios. Users can input body measurements, skinfold measurements, and basic metrics (e.g., weight, height, age) to get estimates of their body fat percentage and related health metrics.

## 📝 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of:
- User-friendly forms for body measurements, skinfold measurements, and basic metrics
- Responsive design principles
- CSS styling for an interactive and clean UI
- Calculations for body fat percentage, lean body mass, and health ratios

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## 🌟 Features
### Form Elements
- Body Measurements:
  - Chest (cm)
  - Waist (cm)
- Skinfold Measurements:
  - Chest Skinfold (mm)
  - Abdomen
  - Thigh Skinfold (mm)
  - Tricep Skinfold (mm)
  - Subscapular Skinfold (mm)
  - Supraliac Skinfold (mm)
  - Midaxillary Skinfold (mm)
- Basic Metrics:
  - Weight (kg)
  - Height (cm)
  - Age (years)

### Calculations
- Body Fat Percentage using the Jackson-Pollock 7-point skinfold formula
- Lean Body Mass estimation
- Waist-to-Height Ratio
- Waist-to-Chest Ratio

### CSS Styling
- Custom input and button styling
- Responsive layout to ensure mobile-friendly design
- Interactive form with easy navigation between sections (body measurements, skinfolds, basic metrics)
- Results display section to show the calculated body composition data

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained practical experience with:
- Structuring forms for collecting user data and handling input validation
- Performing calculations based on user input and displaying results dynamically using JavaScript
- Styling interactive elements like buttons and input fields for better user experience
- Creating a responsive, user-friendly interface for a body composition calculator

## 🎓 Course Information
This project is part of FreeCodeCamp's **Responsive Web Design Certification**, specifically the "Build a Survey Form" section. It also covers relevant principles of JavaScript calculations and dynamic data rendering.

## 💡 Key Concepts Covered
- HTML form structure and form elements
- JavaScript calculations based on user input
- Responsive design principles to ensure mobile compatibility
